# NFT Staking Contract

## Project Description

Build staking mechanisms where NFT holders earn token rewards. This smart contract enables users to stake their NFTs in a reward pool and earn continuous token rewards based on the number of NFTs staked and the duration of staking. The contract provides a decentralized and transparent way for NFT communities to incentivize long-term holding and engagement.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a robust and scalable NFT staking ecosystem that bridges the gap between NFT ownership and DeFi yield generation. We aim to empower NFT holders with passive income opportunities while fostering stronger community engagement and reducing market volatility through long-term staking incentives.

The project envisions becoming a foundational infrastructure for NFT-based economies, where digital assets generate real utility and value for their holders beyond mere speculation.
